# Smart Payment Orchestration
Below you'll find a complete, original project that implements a rule-based payment orchestration mechanism whose goal is to optimize cash flow and reduce per-transaction Stripe fees (target: ~5.8% reduction of fee costs relative) by routing transactions to the best payment rail based on configurable rules (fee, settlement speed, risk, customer preference, etc.). The deliverables:
design & rationale (why rules chosen, tradeoffs)
Node.js/Express microservice (decision engine + API)
rules JSON with examples
lightweight simulator (Python) to measure fee savings across many transactions
DB schema / ledger guidelines and deployment notes
alternatives & extensions.
